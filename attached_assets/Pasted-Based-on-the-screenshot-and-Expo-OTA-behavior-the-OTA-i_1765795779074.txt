Based on the screenshot and Expo OTA behavior, the OTA **is published correctly** but **clients are not pulling it**. This is almost always a **configuration or runtime mismatch**, not a publishing issue.

Below is a **precise diagnostic**, ordered by likelihood.

---

## 1. Branch / Channel mismatch (MOST COMMON)

From the screenshot:

* OTA published to **branch: `preview`**
* Channel: **`preview`**
* Runtime: **`1.0.0`**

Your app will **NOT download** this OTA unless **all three match at runtime**.

### Verify in `app.json / app.config.js`

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "updates": {
      "url": "https://u.expo.dev/<PROJECT_ID>"
    },
    "runtimeVersion": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

### Verify channel at build time

The installed app must be built with:

```bash
eas build --profile preview
```

And your `eas.json` must include:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "preview": {
      "channel": "preview"
    }
  }
}
```

❌ If the app was built on `production` or `default`, it will **never see this OTA**.

---

## 2. App was not restarted after install

OTA updates are:

* **Fetched in background**
* **Applied on reload**

If:

* The app was installed
* Opened once
* Never restarted

→ It may not check yet.

### Force a check (for testing only):

```ts
import * as Updates from 'expo-updates';

await Updates.checkForUpdateAsync();
await Updates.fetchUpdateAsync();
```

Then **reload manually**.

---

## 3. You are testing in Expo Go (OTA will NOT work)

OTA **does NOT work in Expo Go**.

If you are using:

* `expo start`
* Expo Go app

→ OTA downloads will show **zero downloads**.

✅ OTA only works in:

* EAS Dev Client
* Preview build
* Production build

---

## 4. Android downloaded once — further downloads won’t increment

Your screenshot shows:

* Android: **1 download**

That means:

* One device already fetched it
* Further launches **do not re-download the same update**

Expo does **deduplication by fingerprint**.

This is expected behavior.

---

## 5. Runtime fingerprint mismatch

If native code changed (e.g.:

* new native module
* Expo SDK change
* config plugin change)

Then:

* Runtime fingerprint ≠ build fingerprint
* OTA will be silently ignored

### Check:

* Did you recently change:

  * Expo SDK version?
  * Add/remove native libraries?
  * Change app.json plugins?

If yes → **new build required**, OTA cannot apply.

---

## 6. Updates disabled in config

Confirm this is NOT present:

```json
"updates": {
  "enabled": false
}
```

Or environment override:

```bash
EXPO_UPDATES_ENABLED=false
```

---

## 7. Correct expectations (important)

What your screenshot means:

| Item               | Status |
| ------------------ | ------ |
| OTA published      | ✅      |
| Android compatible | ✅      |
| iOS compatible     | ✅      |
| Clients eligible   | ❓      |
| Clients checking   | ❓      |

The OTA system is **passive**.
If clients don’t match **runtime + channel + build**, nothing happens.

---

## Immediate checklist (do these in order)

1. Confirm the installed app was built with:

   * `--profile preview`
   * channel = `preview`
2. Confirm `runtimeVersion` exactly matches `1.0.0`
3. Confirm you are NOT using Expo Go
4. Restart the app completely
5. Add temporary logging:

```ts
console.log(Updates.channel);
console.log(Updates.runtimeVersion);
console.log(Updates.updateId);
```

---

## If you want, I can:

* Verify your `app.json`
* Verify `eas.json`
* Give you a **drop-in OTA debug logger**
* Tell you exactly **why your current build is ignoring the update**

Say which one you want next.
