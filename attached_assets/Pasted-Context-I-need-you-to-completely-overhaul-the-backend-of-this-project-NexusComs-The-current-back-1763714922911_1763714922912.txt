Context: I need you to completely overhaul the backend of this project (NexusComs). The current backend needs to be replaced with Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth).

Visual Reference: I have uploaded two images. I want the UI and workflow to mimic this "Wialon CMS" style:

Main View: A dense data table listing users.

Interaction: Clicking a user opens a detailed "User Properties" view (modal or separate page) with tabs (General, Access, etc.).

Specific Requirements:

1. Backend & Database (Supabase):

Authentication: Implement a secure Login page using Supabase Auth (Email/Password). No access to the dashboard without logging in.

Database: Do not use a local JSON or SQLite file. Connect to a Supabase PostgreSQL instance.

Schema: Based on the reference images, create a SQL definition for a profiles or managed_users table that links to the main auth, containing:

username, creator_id, account_name, billing_plan

host_mask

permissions (JSONB or specific boolean columns for: can_create_objects, can_change_password, is_enabled, etc.)

last_visit timestamp.

2. User Management Dashboard (The UI):

Create a main dashboard that fetches data from the Supabase table.

Style: Render a data table similar to the reference image (Columns: Name, Creator, Account, Billing Plan, Last Visit, Actions).

Functionality:

Row Click: When I click a user row, it must open an "Edit User" view.

Edit View: Create a tabbed interface (General, Access, Advanced). In the "General" tab, include the inputs and checkboxes (Enabled, Can Change Settings, etc.) exactly as shown in the reference image.

CRUD: I must be able to Add a new user, Update their permissions/settings, and Delete a user. All changes must sync back to Supabase.

3. Existing Code Integration:

Analyze the current repo structure. Keep the general styling of NexusComs but replace the data fetching logic to use the @supabase/supabase-js client.

Action Plan:

Install @supabase/supabase-js.

Create the Supabase client setup (I will provide the API URL and Key in Secrets).

Build the Login Page.

Build the User Management Table and Edit Form.
